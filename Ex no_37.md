Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.

Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your variables.

Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:

Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.

Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers.

The second line contains two floating point numbers.

## Constraints 

1 ≤ integer variables ≤ 104

1 ≤ float variables ≤ 104

## Output Format

Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float (scaled to 1 decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.
## Program
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int i,n,sum=0,arr[100];
scanf("%d",&n);
{
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
sum=sum+arr[i];
i++;
}printf("%d",sum);
}
Explanation

When we sum the integers 10 and 4, we get the integer 14. When we subtract the second number 4 from the first number 10, we get 6 as their difference.

When we sum the floating-point numbers 4.0 and 2.0, we get 6.0. When we subtract the second number 2.0 from the first number 4.0, we get 2.0 as their difference.

# #RESULT:
Thus, the program is executed and verified successfully.
